        <h2>About the Campaign</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Pet-Friendly City</strong> is a heartfelt initiative by <strong>CollegeTips.in</strong>, India’s most loved student community. 
          We're on a mission to build a future where pets aren't just tolerated—they're celebrated, protected, and truly welcomed into our urban lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we launch this campaign, we're inviting students, animal lovers, and change-makers to join hands and create pet-positive spaces across cities. 
          Whether it's advocating for pet-friendly parks, organizing adoption drives, or simply spreading awareness—every small act makes a big difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, let’s transform our cities into safe, joyful havens for every paw and tail. 💛🐾

    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
      Every animal deserves a loving home. By adopting a pet, you're not just bringing home a furry friend—
      you're giving them a second chance at life. Shelters and rescue homes are full of animals who have
      been abandoned, lost, or born without a family. When you adopt, you help reduce the stray animal
      population, break the cycle of overbreeding, and gain a loyal companion who will be forever grateful.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-6">
      Adopted pets are known for their resilience, affection, and ability to bond deeply with humans.
      Choosing adoption over buying not only saves a life but also supports a movement that values compassion
      over commercialism. Be a hero—open your heart and home to a pet who’s waiting just for you. 🐶🐾
